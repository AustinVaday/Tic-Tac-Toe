My major contribution to this project was to finish the GUI portion of Tic-Tac-Toe where as Alex Mosologo, my partner has worked on the core program logic. In the last few days, we got together and worked on bug-fixes on game logic, inter-process communication on one computer therefore the commits were mostly done using his computer. I initially started off working with QT GUI then later switched to TCL for flexibility reasons. Some of the initial QT GUI work is shown in a forked version of the final project on my account(likhitha/Tic-Tac-Toe). Some of the history for TTT_TK folder would be missing as I didn't actually commit anything when I was working on named pipes implementation, which later was cancelled as it would have been best suited for this particular project. Most recent contribution was the TTT_TK folder, which has all the GUI related files relating to this project.
