I worked on the core game logic (files located in TTT_core/) and Likhitha worked on the GUI portion (files located in TTT_TK/).  In addition, she had to completely rewrite the GUI because QTGUI turned out to not work for our application.  For the final few days of the project we were both working off of my computer, so nearly all the final commits are from my user even though she also worked on those changes.  They were mainly small bugfixes to get everything to compile, but we also completed the interprocess communication together.
