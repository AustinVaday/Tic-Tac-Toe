Tic Tac Toe game usage

Commands are sent to the game on stdin, and game output is displayed on stdout.  Error messages may appear on stderr.

Moves are sent in the form "move player row col" where the values are as defined below:
player: identifies the player who is making a move.  May be '1' or '2'.
row, col: row and column position on the board for the move.  The top left corner is 0, 0 and the bottom right is 2, 2.  The board positions are shown below.
    0,0|0,1|0,2
    1,0|1,1|1,2
    2,0|2,1|2,2
After each move, the board state is displayed on stdout with empty spaces represented by '0' and occupied spaces represented by their player ID ('1' or '2').
    If the argument --one-line is sent, the output will have all rows on the same line.  Otherwise, each row will be on its own line.
    The --gui argument is used by the GUI interface to the program and should not be used when playing from the command line.

Sending "winner" will check the board for a winner and output the player number of the winner.  0 will be displayed if there is no winner.

The board can be cleared by sending "clear".  After the board is cleared, the board state is displayed as described above.

The game is ended by sending "quit".

If the command sent is not recognized, "ERROR" will be output.
