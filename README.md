# Tic Tac Toe
GUI Tic Tac Toe game with single-computer multiplayer.  This project is designed to be modular and easy to extend.  Each component operates independently so it could be easily interfaced with a new component.  This would allow fairly easy expansion into networked multiplayer, AI players, etc.

## Installation
Once the source code is downloaded, simply run `make` in the root directory of the project.  This will build any needed components and clean up excess files.  The project should compile and run without problems.  
The file **filename** is the main executable for the project.
### Dependencies
The project does not depend on any non-standard C++ or Python libraries.
